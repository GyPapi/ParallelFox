Some work was done to allow ParallelFox workers to run in a multi-threaded DLL, rather than a separate EXE process.  Related code is in ParallelFox.vcx and WorkerMgr.vcx.  This is the project that creates the multi-threaded DLL.  DMULT.DLL by Christof Wollenhaupt is required to create the threads for the workers. This works for the most part, but it never quite made it to release. Maybe one day...
